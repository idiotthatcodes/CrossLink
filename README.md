Discord bot that connects to a Twitch bot!

# CrossLink

What is CrossLink? Great question! CrossLink is a Discord & Twitch bot. What do I mean? CrossLink allows streamers Discord to be connected to their Twitch. So viewers can watch their stream, play minigames and enjoy. After the stream they are able to continue playing minigames in the Discord. With the same inventory, coins, and more! It syncs automaticlly, so no messing with anything!




## FAQ

#### Can I use it already?

unfortunately not, its currently in it's closed ALPHA phase. What does it mean? That there is a selected group of people that has acces to the bot, and there is not space left in here. *YET*

#### When will it be public?

There is no ETA, I'm the only developer working on it and I do not have a lot of time to work on it. I try to work on it when I'm able to.

#### Can I be one of the developers?

Currently I'm not really looking for a extra developer, otherwise I would ask someone I personally know, but thanks!

#### Will it cost money?

The plan is to make the bot entirely free, but this can all changes. It depends on the price of hosting, maintaining and developing of the bot. In case it does cost money you will get notified before it happens.
